This Folder contains my expermenting with GIT Copilot. I prompted it to analyze a log file from my Router and summarize cyber security threats identified. I had it pull the log file "RouterLogMarch.txt" directly from the Repo. It analyzed and summarized what it found. When I prompted it to use a blacklist checker on the web to cross reference the ips in the log file, it was not able to complete that task but it created a python script that used the BlackListChecker API (you will need to use your own API key) to cross reference the IPs in my list and provide an output for each on whether a hit was found. It extracted and hard coded the list of IP's from my log file into the script which was convenient. The file "GIT Copilot Conversation 3rd Try.pdf" is the conversation history of my 3rd iteration of trying to get to cross reference the Ip's to any BlackList reference it could find for each IP.
