I can create a script that you can run locally to cross-reference the IP addresses in the log file with the blacklist checker API. Here's a Python script that uses `requests` to make the API calls and check the blacklist status for each IP address.

```python name=check_blacklist.py
import requests

API_KEY = 'key_ckcRSs82Sa9MaDRCQrmhyUQlB'

# List of IP addresses to check
ip_addresses = [
    '45.57.120.190',
    '35.212.56.18',
    '97.88.136.1',
    '45.57.40.1',
    '142.93.60.243',
    '141.98.11.88',
    '154.213.200.14',
    '205.210.31.229',
    '17.248.203.64',
    '52.123.128.14'
]

def check_blacklist(ip):
    url = f'https://api.blacklistchecker/{ip}'
    response = requests.get(url, auth=(API_KEY, ''))
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        return None

def main():
    results = {}
    for ip in ip_addresses:
        result = check_blacklist(ip)
        if result:
            results[ip] = result
        else:
            results[ip] = 'Error or not found'

    # Print results
    for ip, status in results.items():
        print(f'IP: {ip}, Status: {status}')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Save this script as `check_blacklist.py` and run it. This script will make API calls to the blacklist checker for each IP address in the list and print the results. Make sure you have the `requests` library installed. You can install it using `pip install requests`.

If you need any modifications or have any specific requirements, please let me know!
